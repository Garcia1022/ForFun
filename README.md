Here is some Code I implemented that will solve any maze that is solvable.
The A* path finding can be slow at times, but it will solve the maze with the shortest path.
The McCurdy Algorithm is Lightning fast when solving the maze, but it does not necessarily find the shortest path. 
You can draw your own maze, as long as the back ground is white and the walls are black, and the starting and ending points are two different colors.
The start and end colors cannot be black or white. If there is a path between the start and end, the maze solver should find it.
Also there is a convert.exe program that will convert images to greyscale.
