Here is some Code I implemented that will solve any maze that is solvable.
The A* path finding can be slow at times, but it will solve the maze with the shortest path.
The McCurdy Algorithm is Lightning fast when solving the maze, but it does not necessarily find the shortest path. 
Also there is some a convert.exe program that will convert images to greyscale.
